**I'm reading**

- I finished [Red Rising](https://www.amazon.com/Red-Rising-Pierce-Brown/dp/034553980X). It's a sci-fi page turner that takes several surprising turns. However, the characterisation feels disingenuous and some of the sci-fi conceits stretched my suspension of disbelief. 
- I'm listening to [The Lies of Locke Lamora](https://www.amazon.com/The-Lies-of-Locke-Lamora-audiobook/dp/B082L4QV4C/). I was looking for something to fill my fantasy void since finishing the Demon Cycle books.

**I'm watching**

- We just finished watching [Snow Piercer](https://www.netflix.com/title/80177458) Season 2. It peaked at Episode 8 in terms of tension and suspense, which is probably a good thing. The episode following Melanie has been one of the most memorable episodes of a series I've seen in the past few years.
- I rewatched [Dead Poets Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Poets_Society) which is now streaming on Disney+. A great movie that still looks amazing and inspires.

**April goals**

- Setup some sort of exercise routine.
- Start painting miniatures again.
